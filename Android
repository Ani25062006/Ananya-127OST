Understanding Developmental Model:
   Android is an open-source operating system for mobile devices developed by Google. Its developmental model is based on open collaboration, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to its improvement. Google releases the Android source code, which is available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This open model encourages innovation and diversity in the Android ecosystem.

Licensing:
    Android uses the Apache License 2.0 for its source code. This open-source license allows developers to freely use, modify, and distribute Android, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes, under certain conditions, such as providing proper attribution and adhering to the license terms.

Mode of Funding:
    Google funds the development of Android primarily through its advertising revenue. While the Android operating system itself is open source, Google generates substantial revenue by pre-installing its services (e.g., Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play) on Android devices and earning from app sales and in-app advertising on the Google Play Store.

Commercial Use:
    Android is widely used for commercial purposes. Smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi, incorporate Android into their devices. Businesses also develop Android apps to reach a vast user base. Google's Play Store is a significant platform for commercial Android app distribution.

Non-Commercial Use:
     Android is not limited to commercial use. It is commonly used in non-commercial settings, such as academic research, hobbyist projects, and custom ROM development by the Android community. These non-commercial applications benefit from the open-source nature of Android.
