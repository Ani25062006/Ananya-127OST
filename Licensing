Understanding Developmental Model:

WordPress has a unique developmental model that combines open-source collaboration with a core development team. It follows a community-driven approach where contributors worldwide help build and maintain the platform. The core team manages the project's direction and releases, while anyone can contribute to the codebase, plugins, and themes. This open development model fosters innovation and rapid updates.

Licensing:

WordPress is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means it's free to use, modify, and distribute. The GPL promotes a culture of sharing and collaboration. Anyone can download, customize, and distribute WordPress without any licensing fees. However, any derivative works must also be open-source and GPL-compliant.

Mode of Funding:

WordPress primarily relies on voluntary contributions, donations, and related commercial ventures for funding. The WordPress Foundation oversees these finances and ensures that they are reinvested in the WordPress ecosystem. Revenue comes from sources like Automattic (the company behind WordPress.com and WooCommerce), hosting partnerships, sponsorships, and individual donations. This funding model maintains WordPress's commitment to being freely accessible while supporting its development.

Commercial and Non-Commercial Use:

Commercial Use: WordPress is widely used for commercial purposes. Many businesses, large and small, use it as the foundation for their websites and online stores. Commercial themes and plugins are available for purchase or subscription. E-commerce solutions like WooCommerce enable businesses to sell products online. WordPress also offers various monetization opportunities for developers, designers, and content creators.

Non-Commercial Use: WordPress is equally popular for non-commercial use. It's the go-to platform for bloggers, hobbyists, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and individuals looking to create personal websites, blogs, portfolios, or community forums. Its accessibility, ease of use, and extensive library of free themes and plugins make it a preferred choice for non-profit and community-driven projects.
